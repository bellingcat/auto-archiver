    GsheetsFeederDatabase
    A Google Sheets-based feeder and optional database for the Auto Archiver.

    This reads data from Google Sheets and filters rows based on user-defined rules.
    The filtered rows are processed into `Metadata` objects.

    ### Features
    - Validates the sheet structure and filters rows based on input configurations.
    - Processes only worksheets allowed by the `allow_worksheets` and `block_worksheets` configurations.
    - Ensures only rows with valid URLs and unprocessed statuses are included for archival.
    - Supports organizing stored files into folder paths based on sheet and worksheet names.
    - If the database is enabled, this updates the Google Sheet with the status of the archived URLs, including in progress, success or failure, and method used.
    - Saves metadata such as title, text, timestamp, hashes, screenshots, and media URLs to designated columns.
    - Formats media-specific metadata, such as thumbnails and PDQ hashes for the sheet.
    - Skips redundant updates for empty or invalid data fields.

    ### Setup
    1. Requires a Google Service Account JSON file for authentication.
    To set up a service account, follow the instructions in the [how to](https://auto-archiver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to/gsheets_setup.html),
    or use the script:
    ```
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bellingcat/auto-archiver/refs/heads/main/scripts/generate_google_services.sh)"
    ```
    2. Create a Google sheet with the required column(s) and then define the `sheet` or `sheet_id` configuration to specify this sheet.
    3. Customize the column names in your Google sheet using the `columns` configuration.
    4. The Google Sheet can be used solely as a feeder or as a feeder and database, but note you can't currently feed into the database from an alternate feeder.
